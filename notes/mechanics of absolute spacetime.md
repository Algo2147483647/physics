## Absolute spacetime

### Absolute space & time

Absolute spacetime refers to the idea that space and time exist as independent, unchanging entities, separate from the matter and events that occur within them.

- **Space** is a fixed, uniform, infinite, three-dimensional backdrop where objects are located and distances are measured.
- **Time** is a continuous, one-dimensional flow that ticks the same for everyone, regardless of how they move.

### Galileo's principle of relativity

Galileo's Principle of Relativity asserts the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames. An **inertial reference frame** is one that is not accelerating, meaning it moves at a constant velocity (or is at rest). The transformation relationship between different inertial reference frames:

$$
\begin{align*}
t &= t' \tag{Time invariance}\\
\boldsymbol r &= \boldsymbol r' + \boldsymbol Vt  \tag{Position transformation}\\
\boldsymbol v &= \boldsymbol v' + \boldsymbol V  \tag{Velocity transformation}\\
\end{align*}
$$

- **Time invariance**: Time is absolute and does not change between inertial frames in Galilean relativity.
- **Position transformation**: the position in the original frame $\boldsymbol r$ is related to the position in the moving frame $\boldsymbol r'$ by adding the distance the moving frame has traveled during time $t$, which is $\boldsymbol V t$.
- **Velocity transformation**: the velocity of an object in the original frame $\boldsymbol v$ is the sum of its velocity in the moving frame $\boldsymbol v'$ and the velocity of the moving frame itself $\boldsymbol V$.

## Least Action

- 在没有外力作用下孤立质点保持静止或做匀速直线运动
- 动量为$\boldsymbol P$的质点，在外力的作用下，其动量随时间的变化率同该质点所受的外力成正比，并与外力的方向相同.

$$
\boldsymbol F = \frac{\mathrm{d} \boldsymbol P}{\mathrm{d}t}
$$

- 相互作用的两个质点之间的作用力和反作用力总是大小相等，方向相反，作用在同一条直线上.
  $$
  \boldsymbol F_{12} = - \boldsymbol F_{21}
  $$
  

### Momentum, Angular momentum, Energy

$$
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol P &= m \frac{\mathrm{d} \boldsymbol r}{\mathrm{d}t}\\
\boldsymbol L &= \boldsymbol r \times \boldsymbol P\\
E &= mv^2\\
\end{align*}
$$

## Gravitation

$$
\boldsymbol F = \frac{G m_1m_2}{r^2}\hat{\boldsymbol r}\\
G = (6.67 \pm0.07) \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{m^3kg^{-1}s^{-2}}
$$
