## The Principle of Least Action

### Action & Lagrangian

$$
S = \int L \mathrm{d} t
$$

The action is defined as the integral of the Lagrangian $L$ over time. It provides a unifying principle that describes the dynamics of a system in terms of its energy distribution.

The Lagrangian $L$ is a function that encapsulates the state and dynamics of a system.

### The Principle of Least Action

$$
\delta S = 0
$$



Nature chooses the path between two points in configuration spacetime that makes $S$ stationary.

### Euler-Lagrange equations

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{q}} \right) - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial q} = 0,
$$

where $q$ represents generalized coordinates of the system, and $\dot{q}$ is the time derivative (velocity).
